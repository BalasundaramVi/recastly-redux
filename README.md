# recastly-redux
This is a project I completed as a student at [hackreactor](http://hackreactor.com). This project was worked on with a pair.

**React** is a Javascript library. React's *ultimate* purpose is to show content (HTML) to users and handle user interaction.

React can work by itself, but it can also work with a tremendous variety of other libraries, packages, servers, and databases.

A JavaScript 'class' is part of ES2015. React *components* are made using *either* JavaScript functions or classes.

**JSX** looks like HTML and can be placed in Javascript code. Determines the content of our React app just like normal HTML.

**Event Handlers** are used to detect user interaction and respond to it.

### React is split into two separate libraries:

**React** knows what a component is and how to make components work together.

**ReactDOM** knows how to take a component and make it show up in the DOM.
